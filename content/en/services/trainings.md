More direct than any article, live presentations allow me to tailor a
talk directly to the level of prior knowledge of your audience. I can
also work with you to create and conduct a hands-on training session
on any new technology you wish you introduce to your developers.

Selected prior talks:

- Introduction to Git
- Devops, Cloud & Co: Current Trends in Software Development and System operations
- Why systemd?
